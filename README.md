# SEA8 - Spring JDBC Quest 03 - Update

## Challenge: Updating a school in the database


*Fork* the following repository: https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/quest-spring-jdbc-update.

**Note: this repository is NOT the same as in the previous quest!**

You are developing a Harry Potter fan site and adding functionality. As it stands, the site allows you to modify a character from the universe of the series.

Luckily, the database is the same as in the previous quest. However, if you have deleted it, you can import the database *spring_jdbc_quest here.*

The user *h4rryp0tt3r* is also the same as in the previous quest with the same password *Horcrux4life* and all possible permissions over the database: *spring_jdbc_quest*.

> You should start by testing out the site and seeing how it works.

**Be sure to check out all the classes in the repository before starting the challenge!**

1. Test that the site is working correctly
2. Make it so that it is possible to modify a school via a form, on the route: */school/update*

## Validation criterias

- The project runs well using the required database and user credentials.
- It is possible to update a school.
- The school is properly modified after it is updated.
- The *JDBC* code is in a *repository* class and not in a *controller* class.
- JDBC resources are closed properly.
- The code is available on GitHub.
